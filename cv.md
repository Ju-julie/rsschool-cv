## About me:
My whole career way (and this is more than 10 years) is connected with the development of projects for the preservation, restoration and reconstruction of architectural and cultural heritage objects. 
For a long time I was passionate about my job, grew and developed in it. I went through a career path from an architect-technician to a team leader and chief architect of the project.
But everything good has a downside.
The profession of an architect-restorer is a very narrow, conservative and inert direction, which has many bureaucratic and local restrictions.
Unfortunately, these features of the profession left a certain imprint on my further development and ultimately led to a career impasse.
So I found myself on the path of changing my professional activity.
Studying the issue of choosing a new direction, I became interested in the field of information technology - as one of the most popular and actively developing industries in the world, free and progressive. I see how every day new technologies help people in all spheres of life and are the engine of progress. And I realized, I want to be a small part of this progress.
I believe that my past experience, the ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me to pass this new path and become an experienced Frontend developer.
